# Princeton Algorithms Part 1 - Collinear

Individual project created in 2021 to review algorithms </br>
Passed </br>

About Project </br>
Brute Collinear Points:  </br>
 * Write a program BruteCollinearPoints.java that examines 4 points at a time </br>
 * and checks whether they all lie on the same line segment, returning all such </br>
 * line segments. To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, </br>
 * check whether the three slopes between p and q, between p and r,</br>
 * and between p and s are all equal. </br>

Fast Collinear Points:
 * Given a set of n distinct points in the plane,
 * find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of
 * 4 or more of the points.
